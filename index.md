# Annika Heckel


I am an assistant professor in mathematics at [Uppsala University](https://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N22-71). My research is supported by the Swedish Research Council starting grant `Concentration versus spread - tools, lower bounds and applications', reg. nr. 2022-02829.

Before coming to Uppsala, I held postdoctoral positions at LMU Munich (2019-2022) and the University of Oxford (2016-2019). I completed my [DPhil](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:79e14d55-0589-4e17-bbb5-a216d81b8875) at Oxford in 2017 under the supervision of Oliver Riordan.

## Research

I am interested in combinatorics and probability and the intersection between the two, including random graphs and other random discrete structures. Much of my past research has been about the chromatic number of random graphs.

My work on non-concentration of the chromatic number of G(n, 1/2) was awarded a [2024 Frontiers of Science award](https://www.uu.se/5.51414c891919758bd03baaf.html) in Mathematics at the International Congress of Basic Science. 

Here is a [guest post](https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2021/10/03/to-cheer-you-up-in-difficult-times-32-annika-heckels-guest-post-how-does-the-chromatic-number-of-a-random-graph-vary/) I wrote for Gil Kalai's blog on this result (and its extensions), also mentioned [here](https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/06/28/another-sensation-annika-heckel-non-concentration-of-the-chromatic-number-of-a-random-graph/).
